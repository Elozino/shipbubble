#### Objectives
- Build a simple React Native app to manage and display shipping providers.
- Deploy the app on both iOS and Android platforms.
Features needed
1. Home/Splash screen - Default app screen that displays when the app is first loaded
by the user.
2. Login screen - User should be able to login (you can use mock data), app should
not be accessed if user is not logged in.
3. Home screen - Display some stats on this screen , feel free to use any
implementation (graph, cards, charts etc).
4. Create delivery screen - from the home screen i should be able to navigate to this
screen, basically collecting sender, receiver and item details (validations are a plus)
5. Provider screen - Display a list of shipping providers after the user has filled in
delivery details (you can use shipbubble.com/rates-calculator) to get inspiration of
what it can look like and possibly scrape mock data (please do not recreate what we
have).
a. Each provider listed should navigate to a provider detail screen
b. User should be able to proceed and book delivery and notified of successful
booking
6. Deliveries screen - a list showing my list of shipments (mock data as well) with
navigation to delivery details.
